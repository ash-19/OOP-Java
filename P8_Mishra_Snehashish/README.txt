In my version of Lights Out!, yellow represents ON lights.

Aside from the required stuff, below is a list of all the 
additional features I added, based on the time I had left.

a. Background Music:

	The light ambient background music starts playing as 
	soon as the game starts. It loops endlessly and 
	seamlessly as long as you play the game.

b. Sound Effects:

	1. Unique Lights ON and OFF sound FX:
	
		Turning ON a light sounds differently than 
		turning OFF a light. Both actions have 
		different sound FX with instant playback (no delays).
	
	2. Game Win notification sound:

		The winning dialog box is complemented with
		a distinguishable notification tone.

c. Score Board

	Above the game board, the total number of wins is displayed.

d. Achievements

	Above the game board, current achievement that the player
	has earned is shown. It ranges from 1st win to over 100th win.

e. Sarcastic Winning Notifications

	The winning dialog displays unique messages whenever you win
	a game. The message changes, as you win more and more games
	in a row. Make sure to get to them all, without looking in the
	code first ;) 
	
	HINT: In manual mode, turn a single Light ON and OFF to win 
	rapidly.
